Around is FullStack Social Media App developped by myself and @maximetch.

It is an app that tracks the users location, and make suggestions on places and events based on the user's preferences.

Our app also allows users to create events of their own, over which they have control of the accessibility and visiility.

We used react-native-maps, react-native-reanimated, react-native-google-places-autocomplete, react-native-video and it runs with a MongoDB backend.
